About
=====

Consensus maximization is an effective tool for robust fitting in computer vision. A* Tree Search is one of the most efficient method for globally optimal consensus maximization. In this work, we propose two new techniques that significantly accelerate A* Tree Search, making it capable of handling problems with much larger number of outliers.
